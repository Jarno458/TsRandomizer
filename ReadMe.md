# General
Timespinner Randomizer will randomize the location of items such as equipment, relics, familiars, stat boosts, use items. The logic makes sure that each game you play is beatable

Unlike traditional randomizers, this randomizer will not alter the rom or exe of the game, instead it loads the game normally and alters its state in memory
Save files will be loaded & stored in folder different from the normal game so they are not at risk

The game considers nightmare as the final boss,	thus you require at least access to the past (to break lazer gate), and timespinner wheel, spindle, three gears, keycard A or B and essence of space or lightwall spell to beat the game

Quest are not considered part of the game, and they wont contain any progression item, however Neliste will still offer you an item when you talk to her

When you feel stuck, you can open the minimap and hold X (the key to remove map markers), it will highlight all locations that you can reach and still have items for you

# Routing changes
* The drawbridge is now open by default, and doesn't require you to visit the demon twins

# Item Tracker
The TsRandomizer.ItemTracker.exe can be used to automagicly track any progression item you obtain ingame. It can for example be used by streamers that want to display their current progression items to their viewers
The item tracker features a few options:
* You resize the window width to make it wider or smaller, the items will automatically align properly
* You can double click in the window to remove the borders
* You can use you scroll wheel to make the window bigger of smaller
* You can click with your right mouse button to change the background to a few per-defined backgrounds

# Known bugs
##### I am aware of these issues, but i found them small enough not to fix at this moment
* When you already got the blade-orb and kill the kitty boss while standing at the items spawn point you will trigger the item pickup message but no item is rewarded
* Orb pedestal in room before emperor always spawn even if you didn't kill him yet
* If Timespinner is placed in the incorrect folder it will not display the FileNotFoundMessage as it needs SDL library to do that
* Entering a door backwards with a higher level keycard will permanently open it even when specific keycards are on
* Music wont play in lake desolation until you have done the "oh i lost my mother" cutscene

# Todo
##### Things i plan on doing in the future
* Archipelago TODO:
  * Implement Chat UI
  * Add bouncy to hopefully fix connection losses like due to ip changes
  * Change save game menu to make AP seeds more clear like adding player name & server (optionally)
* Implement skin selection

# Ideas
##### Ideas that may never happen but i think will be fun when they are implemented
* Randomize quest items
* Randomize enemies
* Randomize shop(s)
* Timesanity (entrance randomizer)
* Make warpshard optionally a progression item that unlocks all softlocks
* Maybe make items drop from memories and journals
